description: Preventing slow auth and storage hydration from keeping the native Expo splash visible indefinitely.

Native startup must not depend indefinitely on the API session check. Restore a cached user identity when available and release the startup loading gate with a bounded watchdog; later token validation can still clear an invalid session.

**Why:** Expo Go preview can reach a slow or unreachable production API while restoring a stale token, leaving the app visually stuck behind its startup splash even though the JavaScript bundle loaded successfully.

**How to apply:** Keep the auth hydration timeout separate from request timeouts, preserve the cached identity only as a temporary rendering fallback, and keep protected API calls responsible for final token enforcement.
